### Abandoned Note

**Note:** This fork has been **abandoned** since mid-2018. I currently do not play Ragnarok Online and accessing iRO from where I live is a hassle. **This version will (probably) not work on any current server.**

**For developers:** *If you have basic Win32 reverse engineering skills*, updating this should not be particularly difficult or time-consuming. If you're thinking about picking up the slack, please don't be discouraged by the lack of activity: the reason you (probably) don't see anybody else doing it isn't that you need to be one of the Chosen Ones to figure this stuff out, just collective lack of interest.

If you have any questions you can reach me on Discord (@daxxy#3331). I'm still on iROWiki's server although at the time of writing I haven't been active for months and their #addon-support channel mentioned below was closed a long time ago.

My previous readme follows:

-------

This is **SimpleROHook updated to work with 2018-03-28ragexe from iRO RE:Start**. It *may* also support current (Renewal?) clients from other servers.

I have only tested the Bowling Bash gutterline and M2E functionality; judging by the logging console, some other stuff is definitely still wrong.

This fork also updates the project to Visual Studio 2015 (+ runtime).

Special thanks to [@phaicm](https://github.com/phaicm) for the old default M2E configuration and [@Toxetic](https://github.com/Toxetic) for previously providing trusted binaries and the new default M2E config!

The best place to **get technical support** and be notified of updates is #addon-support on **[iROWiki's Discord](https://discord.gg/Pe7UrnF)**.

### Download/Usage/Installation

* Install the [Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587) (32-bit version, `vc_redist.x86.exe`, even with 64-bit Windows) if you don't have it. If SimpleROHook shows you a "LoadLibrary failed" error, it's likely because you didn't do this.
* **Download the latest build** at https://github.com/drdaxxy/SimpleROHook/releases and extract the archive somewhere.
  * You need "SimpleROHook.xxxx-xx-xx.zip", not the source code.
* Run SimpleROHookCS.exe
  * Only clients started *after* SimpleROHook will be affected. You'll get a logging console for previously started ones, but no actual functionality.
* Right click the SimpleROHook icon in the system tray.
* Uncheck *Window* > *NPC Logger* as it's useless.
* Check *3D Map Grid* > *Show BBE* to show gutterlines.
* The display is a little glitchy on uneven terrain. Adjusting *3D Map Grid* > *Ground Z Bias* can help.
* *3D Map Grid* > *Alpha Level* controls the opacity of the gutterline overlay.
* Feel free to close the console window that pops up when you run a client.

#### Updating

* To update, just replace the files in your existing SimpleROHook installation with the files from the new archive.
* **If you want to keep your settings,** do *not* replace `config.ini` or `config.xml`!

#### Ground skill effect display (M2E)

* Check *3D Map Grid* > *Show M2E* to mark cells currently affected by ground targeting skills (Storm Gust etc.).
* You can edit `config.ini` to set colors for specific skills.

#### New: Custom colors for deadcell/chatscope/castrange/gutterlines

* Since Apr 11, 2018 you can change colors for the other features.
* Edit `config.ini` as with M2E, you'll find a new `[MiscColor]` section at the top.
* If you're updating from a previous version and would like to keep your M2E settings, this is the section you need to add to the top or bottom of the file:
  * **Do not** just add it somewhere in the middle, that would break all following M2E skill colors!

```
[MiscColor]
; Alpha is ignored for these - use the alpha level option in the GUI
Deadcell=0x00FF00FF
Chatscope=0x0000FF00
Castrange=0x007F00FF
Gutterline=0x00FF0000
Demigutter=0x000000FF
```

### Disclaimers

I did the minimum work necessary to make Bowling Bash gutterline display work on the client mentioned above, with only a few minutes of testing. If this ends up crashing your client, I'd appreciate a heads up, but don't yell at me if that loses you an MvP or something.

As of September 24, 2017, iRO's GM team [appears to tolerate gutterline and ground skill target display client edits](https://forums.warpportal.com/index.php?/topic/202141-ro1-in-game-rules-and-guidelines/). Keep in mind they may change their stance at any time and this doesn't necessarily apply to other servers. Whatever you do, use this tool at your own responsibility.

### Build instructions (for developers)

* Install the [August 2007 DirectX SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13287). Other versions **may not work**.
  * **Note:** this will overwrite your original `DXSDK_DIR` environment variable.
  * If you've had the `June 2010 DirectX SDK` installed before, you'll probably want to set it back.
  * Change `Environment Variables` (System variables) path from `DXSDK_DIR` to `DXSDK_AUG07_DIR`.
* Clone this repository.
* Open SimpleROHook.sln in **Visual Studio 2019** and also work in 2017 or 2015 too.
* Install the **MinHook** Nuget packages or compile it libraries.
* Select `Release-iRO/Mixed Platforms` in build configuration.
* Build Solution.
